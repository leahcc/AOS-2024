## Additional Figures

Here I'd like to share some of the original, full size figures included in the poster as well as some figures I produced during my analysis. 

Using the transect count data, I analyzed both the abundance and richness of both resident and migratory birds encountered across the 6 possible treatment conditions (`High Landscape Forest Cover`: `Sun-coffee`, `Shade-coffee`, `Forest` | `Low Landscape Forest Cover`: `Sun-coffee`, `Shade-coffee`, `Forest`).
